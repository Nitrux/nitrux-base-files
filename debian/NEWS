base-files (13.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  By default, snippets for Bourne and Bourne-compatible shells (*.sh)
  in /etc/profile.d will only be sourced by /etc/profile if they
  conform to a sensible regexp including only some ASCII characters,
  as it already happens with cron entries and the like. Previously,
  the behaviour was not really well defined.
